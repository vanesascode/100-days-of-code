# #100DaysOfCode Challenge - Log

### Day 1️⃣: July 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**:  

I’ve been working on a very simple only one page blog. 💻
However, I created a google search bar for the first time, which it is seen in the navbar when screen is wide and in the footer when seen in a mobile. 
🌟 And created a scroll css quite recent effect on the images! (notice that the scroll effect can only be seen in recent Chrome browsers).

**Thoughts:** I’m struggling with the favicon.ico 🤷‍♀️

**Link to work:** I'd like to keep working on it and grow it as professional blog.
