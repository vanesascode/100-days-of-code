# #100DaysOfCode Challenge - Log


### Day 1️⃣: August 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**:  

I’ve been working on a very simple only one page blog. 💻
However, I created a google search bar for the first time, which it is seen in the navbar when screen is wide and in the footer when seen in a mobile. 
🌟 And created a scroll css quite recent effect on the images! (notice that the scroll effect can only be seen in recent Chrome browsers).

**Thoughts:** I’m struggling with the favicon.ico 🤷‍♀️

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

I'd like to keep working on it and grow it as professional blog.

### Day 2️⃣: August 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I’ve been working on a big form for an enrollment context. 📑 
For now, I have just got all the inputs I found around, and kind of organized the labels and inputs using bootstrap 🌟 
I already started adding some Javascript but that is something that needs a lot more work. 

See progress [HERE](https://vanesascode.github.io/super-form-css-bootstrap-javascript/)

**Thoughts:** It's messy with so many inputs 😂

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

My goal is to use as many #html form inputs as I can, to practice with all of them, and to make the form look modern and responsive, as well as functional using javascript.

### Day 3️⃣: August 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I kept working on the Javascript of yesterday’s form. I added: 

Regular expressions(RegEx) to validate user input in form fields.
The “setCustomValidity()” method with the “onvalid” and the “oninput” attributes, to set specific validity rules, and created a validateInput() function to make it all work. 
I created the showValue() function to show the value of the range (slider) input.
Since I couldn’t apply certain rules to the radio and checkbox inputs using the previous, I created a JS file for each, in which there are some functions that make a red message appear below the inputs if no radio or checkbox is selected and that make a textarea appear in case you check the ‘other’ radio or checkbox, so the user can introduce some comments. 

To find more info about all this, check my README.md file in the code. It’s all explained [there](https://github.com/vanesascode/super-form-css-bootstrap-javascript)

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

I don't think in the mobile version the error messages work. So I need to make it work in mobiles as well.

### Day 4️⃣: August 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I improved the performance of the radios.js and checkboxes.js files by storing all the elements I could outside of the functions, and improved the range input visualization. 

I also noticed that in the mobile version, the form didn’t show the validation messages or even the titles, so I had to think about another option. It took me quite a while, but I made it! 🥳 I added a red border and error message to the inputs of the form that were empty or that didn’t follow their defined RegEx pattern. Well, only to the 6 first inputs…

I did it thanks to:

- A function I created to make sure that no input is empty when the user presses the submit button: validateInput(inputName, alertName)
- Another function to validate when the user makes changes to the input: function removeInputErrors(input, alert, regex)
- The stars in this were the “event listeners” of course!!!

To find more info about all this, check my README.md file in the code. It’s all explained [there](https://github.com/vanesascode/super-form-css-bootstrap-javascript)

See progress [HERE](https://vanesascode.github.io/super-form-css-bootstrap-javascript/)

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

Next, I want to spend time finding the way to apply this to the rest of inputs.

### Day 5️⃣: August 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

Today I didn’t code much in order to show something finished. However, I studied GIT for real, with many tutorials ( I specially recommend the ones by [Simon Bao](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev) and practiced #FeatureBranchWorkflow with classmates in the @4geeksacademy classes ( really important to realise if you really know your commands!). 

👉 These skills are as important as coding if you really want to work in a professional team ❗❗

- Here are all my notes, a [long guide which may be useful to learners like me: ](https://github.com/vanesascode/git-cheatsheet)

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

Next I’d like to learn about interactive rebase, cherry-picking, reflog and more.
