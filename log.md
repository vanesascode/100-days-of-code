### Day 1️⃣: August 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**:  

I’ve been working on a very simple only one page blog. 💻
However, I created a google search bar for the first time, which it is seen in the navbar when screen is wide and in the footer when seen in a mobile. 
🌟 And created a scroll css quite recent effect on the images! (notice that the scroll effect can only be seen in recent Chrome browsers).

**Thoughts:** I’m struggling with the favicon.ico 🤷‍♀️

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

I'd like to keep working on it and grow it as professional blog.

### Day 2️⃣: August 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I’ve been working on a big form for an enrollment context. 📑 
For now, I have just got all the inputs I found around, and kind of organized the labels and inputs using bootstrap 🌟 
I already started adding some Javascript but that is something that needs a lot more work. 

See progress [HERE](https://vanesascode.github.io/super-form-css-bootstrap-javascript/)

**Thoughts:** It's messy with so many inputs 😂

🔹 **HOW TO CONTINUE:** 

My goal is to use as many #html form inputs as I can, to practice with all of them, and to make the form look modern and responsive, as well as functional using javascript.
